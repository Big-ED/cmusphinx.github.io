# Lattices


Lattices and word graphs are very important representation of search results 
serving as an itermediate format between recognition passes as well as 
interoperation format with various tools like with machine translation tools.

Lattice contain timing information and this way it can help to describe the 
recognition results with more details than plain 1-best string or n-best lists

Here is important bibliography on lattices:

## Rescoring

HILL CLIMBING ON SPEECH LATTICES: A NEW RESCORING FRAMEWORK 
 
Ariya Rastrow, Markus Dreyer, Abhinav Sethy, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Bhuvana 
Ramabhadran and Mark Dredze

This is a modern method how to rescore lattices efficiently

Another efficient algorithm for lattice expansion

## Confusion Networks

Confusion networks are more simple than lattices still allowing to keep all 
important information inside
